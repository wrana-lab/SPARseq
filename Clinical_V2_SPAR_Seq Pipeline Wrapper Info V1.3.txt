*To install pkgs 
$ module load conda
$ pip install --user [package]

Input folder structure
	/runclX
		-/R1_files
			-fastq files

Resource folder structure
	/resources/SPAR_Seq/
		-/bowtie_index
				-bowtie index files
				-reference fa file
				-reference GTF file
		-codon_aa_table.csv
		-sparseq_pipeline_V1.3.X.sh
		-sparseq_analysis_V1.3.X.py

#-------- Workflow --------#

1. Create run folder runclX and subdirectory R1_files; download fastq files into R1_files
2. Run $bash sparseq_pipeline_V1.3.X.sh path/to/run/folder/runclXX path/to/resource/folder
		> Wrapper script performs the following: 
			i.   unzips fastqs
			ii.  Creates samcounts directory then runs bowtie and HTseq in parallel 
			iii. Creates results directory then run sparseq_analysis_V1.3.py
			vi.  Re-zips FASTQ files
			v.   Prompts user if they want to remove sam files [y/n]    

#-------- Version Changes  --------#

[V1.3]
- Moved bowtie and HTseq steps to be run first
- Now creates result directory and automatically output appropriate files directly into directory 
- Merged the following scripts into one python script and created {components}:

	a. Selected_Var_sum_improved_v4_V1p2_jul2_SB.py
		> {select_vars}
		i. input: *.fastq files
		ii. outputs: R1R2_Srbd_v2_top_PCR_hits.txt, R1R2_Spbs_top_PCR_hits.txt, R1R2_RdRP_top_PCR_hits.txt, important_vars_detailed_vX.txt, runclXX_SelectedVariants.xlsx 

	b. All_top1_var_detailed_out_vV1p2_june27_SB.py
		> {all_top}
		i. input - *.fastq files and and codon_aa_table.csv
		ii. outputs - SparSeq_RdRP_top1_Var_summary_table.txt, SparSeq_Srbd_v2_top1_Var_summary_table.txt, SparSeq_Spbs_top1_Var_summary_table.txt, runclXX_AllVariantDetails.xlsx

	c.	bowtie_count_table.py (v4)				
		> {bowtie_count}
		i. input - *sam.count.txt files
		ii. outputs - bowtie_count_table_v#.txt, runclXX_CountTable.txt, runclXX_CountTable.xlsx

	d.	variant_agg_SSV1.2_v12.R
		> {variant_agg}
		i. input - runcl*_CountTable.txt, SparSeq_Srbd_v2_top1_Var_summary_table.txt and runcl*_SelectedVariants.txt files
		ii. outputs: sparseq_report_runclXX.xlsx
	
	- accounts for steps 2, 3, 4, 6-12 in in workflow_SSV1.2_v9 (described in more detail below)
	- added shebang line (important for OS execution)
	- closed all opened documents (important to maintain file integrity)
	- added arguments for increased flexibility/use with wrapper script:
		> run_folder & resource_folder paths

	- added optional flags --start [select_vars|all_top|bowtie_count|variant_agg] and --intermediates [Y|N]
		> can start at a different component of the script or keep intermediate files (HTseq outputs) without having to go in and modify the script directly
		>> $python3 sparseq_analysis_v1.py path/run_folder path/resource_folder --start all_top --intermediates Y

	- added regex to parse sample ID, run ID and script versioning
	- added functionality to add well to sample ID if detects as a duplicate sample ID
	- liminted amount of nested loops (increases runtime)

	a. {select_vars}
	- removed need for SE_fastq.txt file script will look into R1_file folder
		> eliminates step 2 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9
		>> Fill in sample IDs in SE_fastq_files.txt file $ls *.fastq > SE_fastq_files.txt
	- now uses 12bp version for count dictionary (ie. "AGAGATATTT" has been replaced with "AGAGAGATATTT") for consistency with {all_top}
	- added runclXX_SelectedVariants.xlsx output 
		> replaces step 10 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9:
			>> Copy the outputs "important_vars_detailed_V4.txt" and "SparSeq_Srbd_v2_top1_Var_summary_table.txt" from R1_files to the main folder. Open important_vars_detailed_V4.txt in excel, split with TextToColumns if needed, save as  runclXX_SelectedVariants.xlsx

	- added runclXX_SelectedVariants.txt ouput to be used for {variant_agg}
		> workaround for issue with .xlsx output creation via openpyxl; openpyxl won't be able to read file until workbook has been opened and saved 
	

	b. {all_top}
	- removed need for SE_fastq.txt file script will look into R1_file folder
		> eliminates step 2 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9:
		>> Fill in sample IDs in SE_fastq_files.txt file $ls *.fastq > SE_fastq_files.txt

	- removed need for additional loop through FASTQs, combined with {select_vars}
	- removed need for additional creation of target counts, combined with {select_vars}
	- eliminated duplicated code by defining internal functions to create target count nt/aa dictionaries
	- added in functionality to automatically add newline to samples with short lines
		> script displays warning message on screen indicating sample and file with missing data

	- added runclXX_AllVariantDetails.xlsx output
		> replaces step 12 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9:
		>> Take the 3 SparSeq...._summary_table.txt files from R1_files, open in excel, use text to columns button to split the data by ","  and save as one excel file with 3 sheets - RunCLXX_AllDetailedResults.xlsx (now runclXX_AllVariantDetails.xlsx)

	c. {bowtie_counts}
    - removed need for samCountsOut.txt script will look into samcounts folder
    	> replaces steps 6 & 7 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9:
		>> in R1_files, move the counts files to samcounts: $mv *.count.txt samcounts
		>> Move to samcounts and copy names of files into a separate text file $cd samcounts/$ls *.count.txt > samCountOuts.txt

	- removed double looping of count.txt outputs script now adds header line if first iteration
    - added in fields sample and filename directly to output
	- added runc1XX_Counts.xlxs output including generation of total.viral and total.raw.read fields
		> replaces step 9 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9:
		>> Copy the bowtie_count_table_v3.txt file from samcounts to main folder.  This is the total bowtie counts for each amplicon per sample plus some extra info. Open it in excel and do these things:
			-add a new column called total.viral and make it the sum of Rdrp, Spoly, Srbd_v2 and Srbd. 
			-add a new column called total.raw.reads and make it the sum of everything except total.viral
			-copy the filename to a column on the end and name the column 'filename'	-copy it again to the next column and use Data->TextToColumn to split by _ to separate the W#
			-cut and paste the W# in column A to replace original filenames, name the column "sample", and delete the rest of the stuff from TextToColumn
			-save as runclXX_counts.xlsx

	- added output runclXX_CountTable.txt 
		- kept generation of bowtie_count_table_vX.txt just in case its needed
		> workaround for issue with .xlsx output creation via openpyxl; openpyxl won't be able to read file until workbook has been opened and saved 

	- removed unused columns in bowtie_counts_v*.txt output
	 > "Srbd", "__no_feature", "__ambiguous", "__too_low_aQual","__alignment_not_unique"

 	- added the removal of HTseq output files (unless specified to keep using --intermediates Y) after files are generated

	d. {variant_agg} 
	- added to script so no longer needs to be run interactively
 	- in/output filenames and date automatically determined within scripts
		> replaces step 11 in workflow_SSV1.2_v9: 
		>> Open R script variant_agg_v4.R and run script, changing working directory at the top,  input filenames as needed, date at line 83 and output filename at line 104
	- added in handling of different sample IDs (X*/W*/Neg) when building Samples/ControlsOnly dataframes

- added in line to rezip FASTQs after analysis
- added in line to prompt user if they want to remove .sam files
	> [-I flag] since this is a computationally intensive step wanted to put a buffer in place incase there was an issue with the output files 

[V1.3.1]
- Updated script version regex to account for 'V'
- Outputs numbers instead of text for runclXX_CountTable.xlsx 

[V1.3.2]
- Fixed issue with regex via increasing amount of allowed sample digits from {1,2} to {1,4}
