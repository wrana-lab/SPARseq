# SPARseq
This is the code for the Wrana Lab's [Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Toronto, Canada] SPARseq analysis pipeline (V1). Originally designed and written by Seda Barutcu [https://github.com/seda-barutcu/MultiplexedPCR-DeepSequence-Analysis], upgraded and streamlined by Kathleen-Rose Zakoor, and maintained and updated by Lauren Caldwell. 

Requirements:

* OSX or Linux system
* Python3.9 [https://www.python.org/]
* R version 4+ [https://www.r-project.org/]
* Bowtie [http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml]
* HTSeq [https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/]


Versions

As covid19 variants emerged, we updated the analysis pipeline. The initial research version was used from January 2021-May 2021. When we began running the analysis daily in June 2021, we updated the pipeline into what is called the V1 pipeline. At the end of June 2021, we replaced the Srbd amplicon with a slightly longer one to have more coverage.
